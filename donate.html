    <p>With your donation, you allow Maranatha Manor to continue it's goals and growth.<p>Newly renovated and updated, your loved will enjoy these precious years of their life. It is the goal of every member of our staff to be sensitive to the expressed and unexpressed wishes and needs of our residents. </p><p>We are a 501c3 non profit and all Gifts are Tax deductible.
</p>    

We strive to provide affordable, uncommon care that honors Christ. We need regular gifts for our operating budget to work each year. Without your donations, many of our people not be able to be blessed by the tender care and homey atmosphere at Maranatha Manor.
<p></p>
All of the extra things that bless us come through caring  donors. Large gifts and small can be used to enhance the lives of our special residents.

The man who spent forty years as a missionary in Africa, sits quietly, admiring his newly remodeled  living room every day. He also thoroughly enjoys having Oreos readily available as an available snack. Even the little things touch his life.
<p></p>
The new widower chokes up and leans into a tender hug from a staff member as he shares a dear memory of his wife of 65 years.
<p></p>
A dear widow who served faithfully beside her husband who was a pastor, enjoys the immediate response to her call button, now that she is the one who needs to be supported and served.
<p></p>
The single lady who spent her life sharing the news of Jesus from a small boat on the Amazon, smiles broadly as she chooses the color for her walls for the first time in her life. She tells us how the comfort of Maranatha Manor is quite different from her stilt home where the children giggled as they peaked up through the cracks in the floor.
<p></p>
The gifts of generous donors changed the lives of every Manor resident since 2001. Will you be a part of touching lives with us in the years to come?
<p></p>
It is our goal to provide a standard of care and hospitality that is incomparable in the assisted living community. Because our people deserve that. Fathers, mothers, widows and widowers all thrive in such a unique environment.
